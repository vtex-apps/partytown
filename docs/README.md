Partytown is app to manage your third party scripts.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Partytown is currently in Alpha**. Which means it's still not a final version and may have flaws. We recommend always testing all scripts while implementing this guide.

## Usage
### Installing partytown

Install the `vtex.partytown` on your new workspace by running `vtex install vtex.partytown@0.0.1-alpha.19`

### Migrating your pixel app to the partytown format

1. Open the `pixel/head.html` file

2. Add the `type="text/partytown"` attribute to each individual `<script>` tag
```diff
- <script>...</script>
+ <script type="text/partytown">...</script>
```

3. (Optional) If you want to access some global variables added to the `window` by the pixel apps, you need to declare it. Go to the `https://{{myworkspace}}--{{myaccount}}.myvtex.com/admin/apps` URL, select the `partytown` app and then add the name of the variables you want to access in the `Forward` field.

## Development

Modify the `src/head.html` file and run the `yar run build` command.
